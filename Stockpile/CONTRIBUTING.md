*Heads up*

I am very new to programming and I am very inexperienced with git, GitHub, and programming languages in general. My code is probably not following the industry's best practices, and therefore I ask you to be indulgent with your review of the code's quality. Stockpile is my first real programming project. Yet, I am confident Stockpile has a purpose and can be maintained and improved to be truly great!

# Contributing to Stockpile

**Thank you for taking an interest in Stockpile!**
I would very much like the CC: Tweaked community to participate in Stockpile and make it truly great. I also want to maintain it and bug test, however, as a very novice programmer, I would need some help to do that!

You can contribute in the following ways:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Coding client and compatibility programs to interface Stockpile with other CC creations and Minecraft mods
- Becoming a maintainer

## Code change guidelines
I developed Stockpile on `Minecraft 1.20.1, Lua v5.2 CC: Tweaked 1.114.2 with CraftOS v1.9`. If you would like to contribute to the project, I recommend you do it using the same environment. However, you can specifically try to improve backward compatibility if you wish and develop under lower versions of CC: Tweaked and Minecraft.

I didn't make the code the most understandable, even though I tried to refactor it as much as I could and make the variables and function names readable.

If you have a question about the code, feel free to ask on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/MintTee/Stockpile/issues). If enough people show interest in contributing to Stockpile, I will open a Discord server for it.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/MintTee/Stockpile/issues); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Crediting
When you make your pull request, remind me to credit you! I want to make sure everyone's contributions are recognized.

By contributing code to Stockpile, you agree to assign the copyright of your contributions to Martin Bost, the creator of Stockpile.
